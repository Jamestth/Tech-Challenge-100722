# Introduction
This section tackles the 1st section of the Data Engineer Tech Challenge TAP. 

The prompt is as follows:
>You are tasked to help an agency to consolidate data to reduce data silos over a 3 months period. You will prepare a presentation to executive leadership to influence them to sponsor this data engineering initiative.
>
>Your use-case can be any business function that you are familiar with. You should consider the different perspectives of the stakeholders. Do include a definition of the use case as well as be prepared to dive deep in technical considerations.
>Choose one of the following topics and prepare the presentation in relation to the scenario above:
>
>1. What is Data Engineering?
>2. Explain the value of using any Data Engineering concepts or technology needed to the solve data silos.
>3. What is a Data Warehouse?
>
>This is a 5 minute face to face presentation. The audience includes senior managers, including directors from technical as well as non-technical backgrounds.
>
>Management is interested to hear what can be done with data engineering to solve the problem described above. Please exercise your own judgement to make any reasonable assumptions and submit the powerpoint presentation.




# Scenario Planning (Must Read before Viewing Slides)
In this section I will describe the scenario and agency that I will base the presentation on. This may not be the actual scenario in the real world.<br>

A*Star has more than 20 Research Institutes (RI) under its care. Each RI typically operates on its own which naturally lead data silos between the RIs. While data silos is generally better for data privacy and security, HQ believes that information sharing between RI is important as well. Information sharing can lead to more synergies between RIs and hence better and more effective use of resources. 

Generally, RIs have their own database systems and do not share research data with HQ. Since RIs have their own Silos, it is very likely that different RIs may have conducted similar research without knowing that granular past research data may exist within other RIs, leading to redundancy. 

In this scenario, I will be representing GovTech to present to A*Star HQ senior management on how data engineering can be used to encourage information sharing between RIs and benefit HQ at the same time. I will be advocating for a centralised Data Warehouse to fit the assessment criteria. (However, I think a Data Lake might be a better solution instead given the unstructured nature of research data)
